However, we as humans are incapable of tracing our fingers through its answers to understand how it came up with them. What this work aims to do is create a methodology for explainably detailing the importance that individual features of data have in contributing to correct characterizations of material samples.\n[]\nThe figure shown above describes the process by which ExplainHD, the aforementioned methodology, operates to classify part samples. [DESCRIBE THE FIGURE FURTHER HERE]\n\nPSPRAG: Utilizing an Efficient Language Model to Access In-Depth Material Information for Additive Manufacturing\n\nBecause of the multiphysics nature of additive manufacturing, much study has been taken to identify the behavior of a given material within a given process under given processing conditions. These previous research works have identified which sets of parameters are productive, but because of the wide variety of setups and final results, it is difficult to easily identify correct interpolations and valuable information for additive manufacturing calibration. To remedy this, I wrote my thesis about my work on PSPRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation method for generating accurate process-structure-property-related information for a given"

Obviously, some of you will come here looking for resume stuff, and that’s fine by me. I’ll even point you in the right direction for that here.\nBut, there’s a lot of things I wanna talk about. So, if you have the time, feel free to roam and see what I’ve put up here. Who knows, maybe I’ll even have a video or two for you to look at!"
