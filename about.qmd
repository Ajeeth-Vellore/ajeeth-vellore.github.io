Hey folks! My name is Ajeeth Vellore, and I'm a mechanical engineer by education
(but many other things by circumstance) and this website is a place where I
express myself a little bit. Obviously, some of you will come here looking for
resume stuff, and that's fine by me. I'll even point you in the right direction
for that here.

But, there's a lot of things I wanna talk about. So, if you have the time, feel
free to roam and see what I've put up here. Who knows, maybe I'll even have a
video or two for you to look at!
